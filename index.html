				<h1>Our Industry Can Do Better</h1>
				<p id="intro-paragraph">
					[REPLACE THIS] As women in computer science, we have all felt frustrations within the tech industry and how
					prevalent mental health issues can be. While tech companies are attempting to address the issue, it is clear
					that the issue has not been resolved, and there are still greater steps we can take. Therefore, we would like
					to investigate and highlight trends within the tech industry about mental health, specifically focusing on
					trends across gendered and racialized categories and the efficacy of corporate benefits and wellness
					programs. We also are curious about the impact of remote work on mental health within this industry. Our
					current goals are to spread awareness about where the tech industry might be failing its employees and what
					it can possibly do better.

				While policies around mental health seem to be improving on paper, simply offering benefits is only half
				the battle. Despite these widely available benefits, the data show that tech employees are still reluctant
				to utilize these benefits or to disclose their mental health with their employers, exposing a wide gap
				between the potential of benefits and their actual efficacy. The conversation around mental health may
				have started, but how prepared is the tech industry to carry it out?

				<p>
					We measured the difference between the representation of different gender identities and their responses
					to the culture and policies around mental health in the industry in order to fully focus on how mental
					health is affected for each gender demographic. In other words, is the distribution of gender within the
					industry consistent with the distribution of gender among positive perceptions of how the workplace
					handles mental health?
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to analyze these distributions, we subtracted the proportion of each gender identity among the
					respondents who indicated a positive perception of mental health policy/company culture from the proportion
					of that gender out of the total respondents. The resulting proportion depicts the difference in gender
					representation for a given statement where 0 indicates no difference in perception based on gender. In
					this visualization, a positive perception is interpreted as a positive value (+) whereas a response
					implying a stigmatized or inadequate perception of mental health response is encoded as a negative value (-).

				So what does the data tell us? When considering the representation of men in the industry, males
				disproportionately believe there are inadequacies in policies and benefits offered by their companies but
				would feel comfortable utilizing them in comparison to women and gender-nonconforming groups. However,
				women and gender-nonconforming groups disproportionately perceive a cultural stigma against mental health
				in the workplace compared to men and do not utilize the available benefits despite their awareness of them.

			<p class="story-text">
				This leaves us with an alarming gender discrepancy within the tech industry’s understanding and attitude
				around mental health. While it may seem that gender identity may impact perceptions about mental health
				differently, both opinions are rooted in a problematic cultural stigma around mental health. Within the
				industry, men are assumed to not need mental health benefits as much and therefore lack an awareness about
				the benefits out there. Women and gender-nonconforming groups, on the other hand, receive more priority
				when companies promote their benefits in theory, but the remnant discriminatory attitude about these
				gender identities have created a hostile industry culture that stigmatizes mental health concerns in practice.
			</p>
			<p class="story-text">
				In order to truly improve mental health in the tech industry, we must begin with reforming the cultural
				understanding and attitude about how mental health impacts everyone. Men, too, struggle with mental health,
				and within an industry that favors them, they will utilize these benefits if they are encouraged. As for
				women and gender-nonconforming groups, we must “walk the walk” by creating a supportive culture that makes
				them feel safe and valued. Only in a culture that fully empowers all can we truly improve the mental health
				that so many struggle with in the tech world.
