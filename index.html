					Although the tech industry is relatively young compared to other fields, they have come to dominate our
					social and cultural world and have attracted more and more employees, both young and old. Despite the
					initial glamor associated with Silicon Valley and the seemingly welcoming environment of comfortable
					workspaces and touted wellness days, the tech space continues to be plagued by mental health issues
					from its employees. So what is the root of the problem? Where can we do better?

			<h3>How much does gender impact perceptions of mental health?</h3>

			<h5>The confounding role that gender plays in industry stigma</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<p class="story-text">
				In an ideal world where gender has no impact on navigating mental health in the industry, we'd see no
				difference between the observed and expected gender breakdowns, but we've seen how that isn't the case.
				<b>But how drastic is the gap?</b> In other words, is the distribution of gender within the industry consistent
				with the distribution of gender among positive perceptions of how the workplace handles mental health?
				For this exercise, we define positive perception to be <u>an affirmative response that the respondent is
				aware of mental health policies or comfortable with the culture surrounding mental health at their company.</u>

				To measure the gap, we subtracted the proportion of each gender identity among the respondents who indicated
				a positive perception from the proportion of that gender out of the total respondents. <b>The resulting
				proportion depicts the difference in gender representation for a given statement where 0 indicates no
				difference in perception based on gender</b>.
			</p>
			<p class="story-text">
				So what does the data tell us? When considering the representation of men in the industry, males
				disproportionately believe there are inadequacies in policies and benefits offered by their companies but
				would feel comfortable utilizing them in comparison to women and gender-nonconforming groups. However,
				women and gender-nonconforming groups disproportionately perceive a cultural stigma against mental health
				in the workplace compared to men and do not utilize the available benefits despite their awareness of them.

			<p class="story-text">
				This leaves us with an alarming gender discrepancy within the tech industry’s understanding and attitude
				around mental health. While it may seem that gender identity may impact perceptions about mental health
				differently, both opinions are rooted in a <b>problematic cultural stigma around mental health</b>. Within the
				industry, men are assumed to not need mental health benefits as much and therefore lack an awareness about
				the benefits out there. Women and gender-nonconforming groups, on the other hand, receive more priority
				when companies promote their benefits in theory, but the remnant discriminatory attitude about these
				gender identities have created a hostile industry culture that stigmatizes mental health concerns in practice.
			<br><br>
				In order to truly improve mental health in the tech industry, we must begin with reforming the cultural
				understanding and attitude about how mental health impacts everyone. Men, too, struggle with mental health,
				and within an industry that favors them, they will utilize these benefits if they are encouraged. As for
				women and gender-nonconforming groups, we must “walk the walk” by creating a supportive culture that makes
				them feel safe and valued. Only in a culture that fully empowers all can we truly improve the mental health
				that so many struggle with in the tech world.
